Every time you come around
You know i can't say no
Every time the sun goes down
I let you take control
I can feel the paradise
Before my world implodes
And tonight i had something wonderful
My bad habits lead to late nights
Endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger
I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last
But it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose
Or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes
Stare into space
And i know i'll lose control
Of the things that i say
Yeah, i was lookin' for a way out
Now i can't escape
Nothin' happens aftеr two
It's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lеad to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Every pure intention ends
When the good times start
Fallin' over everything
To reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights
And then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far
My bad habits lead to late nights
Endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger
I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last
But it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose
Or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes
Stare into space
And i know i'll lose control
Of the things that i say
Yeah, i was lookin' for a way out
Now i can't escape
Nothin' happens aftеr two
It's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
We took the long way 'round
And burned 'til the fun ran out, now
My bad habits lead to late nights
Endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger
I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last
But it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose
Or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes
Stare into space
And i know i'll lose control
Of the things that i say
Yeah, i was lookin' for a way out
Now i can't escape
Nothin' happens aftеr two
It's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
