I Had A Bad Week
Spent The Evening Pretending It Wasn't That Deep
You Could See In My Eyes That It Was Taking Over
I Guess I Was Just Blind And Caught Up In The Moment
You Know You Take All Of My Stress Right Down
Help Me Get It Off My Chest And Out
Into The Ether With The Rest Of This
Mess That Just Keeps Us Depressed
We Forget That We're Here Right Now
'Cuz We're Living Life At A Different Pace
Stuck In A Constant Race
Keep The Pressure On, You're Bound To Break
Something's Got To Change
We Should Just Be Cancelling All Our Plans
And Not Give A Damn
If We're Missin' Out On What The People Think Is Right
Seein' Through A Picture Behind The Screen And Forget To Be
Lucid Conversation For The Message That You'll Never Read
I Think Maybe You And Me
Oh! We Should Head Out To The Place
Where The Music Plays And Then
We'll Go All Night
Two-Stepping With The Woman I Love
All My Troubles Turning Up
And When I'm In Your Eyes, Electrified
We'll Keep Turning Up And Go All Night
Oh! We Had Dips And Falls In Our Time
But We Know What It Feels To Be Low, Then Up
Alone And Loved
And All We Need Is Us To Go All
Night, Night
Two-Stepping With The Woman I Love
Night, Yeah!
All We Need Is Us
What Do You Reckon, Is It Just Me?
Words Are Weapons And Occasionally They Cut Deep
Crisis Of Confidence, It Tends To Come
When I Feel The Dark And I Open My Heart
If You Don't See It, You Should Trust Me
I Feel Like I've Got Nothing Left Right Now
Except This Beauty In Her Dress Right Now
She Got Me Feeling Like The Best
And The Rest Are Just Less
Then She Needs
So We Press Play And Step To The Beat
'Cuz We're Living Life At A Different Pace
Stuck In A Constant Race
Keep The Pressure On, You're Bound To Break
Something's Got To Change
We Should Just Be Cancelling All Our Plans
And Not Give A Damn
Head Out To The Place Where It Plays And
We'll Go All Night
Two-Stepping With The Woman I Love
All My Troubles Turning Up
And When I'm In Your Eyes, Electrified
We'll Keep Turning Up And Go All Night
Oh! We Had Dips And Falls In Our Time
But We Know What It Feels To Be Low
Then Up, Alone And Loved
And All We Need Is Us To Go All
Night, Night
Two-Stepping With The Woman I Love
Night, Yeah!
All We Need Is Us To Go All Night
Night, Night
Two-Stepping With The Woman I Love
Night, Yeah!
All We Need Is Us To Go All Night
